# A Collection of Arduino Projects

This is just a collection of arduino projects and libraries which I
have written over time that you are welcome to use or to modify for
your particular needs. Most of these are written quickly with a focus
on functionality, no points for style. All files are licensed under

* TempHumidityMonitor - Written for a NodeMCU-32s this project will
  record temperature and humidity and send various emails and alerts.
